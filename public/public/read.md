Configuration
Your bot requires a Discord bot token and other sensitive information. These must be stored in a .env file for security.

Create a file named .env in the root of your project. Do not share this file with anyone! It contains your secret keys and tokens.

Add the following variables to the .env file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials from the Discord Developer Portal:

TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID
GUILD_ID=YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_ID


The GUILD_ID is for instantly registering slash commands to a single server for testing purposes.

Running the Bot
Once everything is configured, you can start your bot:

node index.js
